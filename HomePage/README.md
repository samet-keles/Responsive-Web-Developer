Our project aims to create a dynamic and user-friendly homepage that meets all of the specified design requirements.

- To see a live demo of the project, click on the provided [link.](https://homepage-sametkeles.vercel.app/)

- This project involves a mobile-first approach to developing a responsive homepage template that is fully compatible with all modern browsers. The '[can i use](https://caniuse.com/)' website was utilized to ensure browser compatibility. Additionally, any browser differences were resolved using normalize and formalize.css, and autoprefix was applied to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

- In order to improve the performance of the project, images were converted to the webp format, and lazy loading was implemented for all images except the first loaded one. A high fetch priority preload was used, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files were compressed.
