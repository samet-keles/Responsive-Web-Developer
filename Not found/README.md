- The objective of this project is to create a responsive 404 error page that adheres to the established design specifications.

- During the development of the project, I employed the use of rem units to ensure that the dimensions were both dynamic and responsive. To improve readability, I also separated the style files into manageable chunks. Given the simplicity of the project's structure, I chose not to extensively divide the style files. However, for future projects with more complex structures, I plan to use a component-based approach for organizing the style files.
